<p>
I am a Master's student in Computer Engineering and I currently work at my local university as a research assistant in <a href="https://www.crysys.hu/">CrySys lab</a>.
My work there is centered around researching <b>machine learning privacy</b>.
This blog will be a place where I will share some of the most interesting things I work (or used to work) on.
</p> 

<p>
<b>Machine learning</b> was one of the first extracurricular things that I started pursuing - after my first year in university

I was an intern at Prezi for 6 weeks, where I worked on <b>network anomaly detection</b>. Starting machine learning on an unsupervised
problem was not easy, but it was one of the periods in my life where I learned the most. 
<br>

My interest in research began when I started working on <b>driver fingerprinting</b> in my third year of university.

I won second place at the Student's Scientific Association in 2018 with my paper titled 
<a href="https://tdk.bme.hu/VIK/ViewPaper/Vezeto-Azonositas-es-Szemelyes-Adatok1"><i>Driver Identification and Personal Attribute Inference from In-Vehicle Network Log</i></a>.

A continuation of this work led me to my 2019 publication in the subject.
<br>

For my thesis, I decided to learn about <b>mining software repositories</b> and combining it with automatic <b>commit classification</b> at Cloudera.

My paper called <a href="https://tdk.bme.hu/VIK/ViewPaper/Egy-jobb-kodvaltoztatas-cimkezo-algoritmus"><i>Enhanced-SZZ: an improved code change labeling algorithm</i></a>
earned me first place at the Student's Scientific Association in 2019.
